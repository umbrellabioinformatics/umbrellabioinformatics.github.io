												<h3>Large-scale simulation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The development of powerful methods to solve larger and larger molecular assemblies, open to the door for the exploration of new structures that were previously studied by dissecting them. On the other hand the development and implementation of various simulation packages such as: GROMACS and NAMD, etc. they have made the simulation of large supramolecular complexes accessible, which have led to a better understanding, due to the atomistic detail that they are provide; These parks have accelerated even more thanks to the implementation of parallel work and the famous GPU graphics cards. In this line, these packages are used to explore the molecular mechanisms of large assemblies such as the Ribosome, for example.</p>

												<h3>Vaccine and Drug discovery</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Global health is of the utmost importance, for the proper development of our society, but this has been affected by the increasing exposure of people to new pathogens which are very aggressive for example the Ebola Virus, which can kill in question of days, therefore having prevention, treatment and prophylactic measures are of the utmost importance. However, the development of vaccines and drugs, by experimental methods takes a long time, which is a problem with emerging pathogens of rapid dispersion. That is why in this line of research we focus on using computational methods for the development of drugs and vaccines, which reduce time and facilitate rapid intervention, after experimental validation.</p>

												<h3>Membrane proteins</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Membrane proteins are one of the most important doors, for cellular communication, since they allow the entry and exit of chemical species, which can be ions of Ca2 +, K +, Na +, which maintain the membrane potential, thus facilitating , communication, for example neuronal. These have different mechanisms of activation, and in this line they are predicted to understand those mechanisms and their regulation, using biomolecular simulation, with various theoretical methods implemented in the different simulation packages, such as steered molecular dynamics, which allows to join an imaginary spring to a group of atoms, to pull them with a constant speed or force, which allows us to force, for example, transport through the membrane in a reasonable time of simulation.</p>

									<h3>1. Large-scale simulation of dynein from Leismania braziliensis</h3>
									<p>Parasites of the genus Leishmania are zoonotic agents of Leishmaniasis, a human disease described in different regions of the world. This genus belongs to the Kinetoplastida order and Trypanosomatidae family. They are protozoans, have a kinetoplast and a flagellum that emerges from their cell body. Leishmania has two forms in their life cycle: amastigote (intracellular without movement in vertebrate tissues) and promastigote (flagellated, develop in the digestive tract of invertebrate hosts). As for its survival, the motility produced by its flagellum is of the utmost importance, where dyneins, a large family of proteins that form molecular motors, play a major role. The objective of the present work is the large-scale simulation of the dyneins of L. braziliensis (parasite present in the Central and South America tropical zones, including Peru), where the search for inhibitors, conformational changes, and potential allosteric changes in specific regions will be carried out using essential dynamics, normal model analysis, and scripts in TCL made by ourselves. The simulation will be on GPU in VMD / NAMD.</p>

									<h3>2. Molecular Dynamics of Arbovirus Envelope as Drug Targets</h3>
									<p>Zika and Dengue viruses can cause infections with mild and self-limited symptoms in humans; however, they can also cause serious consequences such as microcephaly and severe dengue (previously known as hemorrhagic dengue), respectively. Both viruses have three structural proteins. C protein forms the capsid, while E and M proteins are part of the envelope that covers C protein . E and M proteins are involved in cell entry, fusion with the host and assembly of the virion. In addition, E protein is the main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies. Therefore, these structural proteins would be important targets for antivirals. The present work has as objective to make evaluations of the possible effect of small molecules on the structure, stability, dynamics, and to determine geometric properties of perturbation of assemblies of the E and M proteins of the Zika and Dengue viruses in order to find new antiviral candidates . For this, molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out in VMD/NAMD of the dockings between viral assemblies and drug candidates, using essential dynamics and normal model analysis.</p>

									<h3>3. Development pan-drugs agaist Plasmodium falciparum</h3>
									<p>Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by a parasite, in humans it is transmitted through the bite of a mosquito of the genus Anopheles, the infection is caused by one or more of four species of intracellular protozoan parasites: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax , P. ovale and P. malariae according to geographical distribution, over time malaria has become a potential for developing resistance to antimalarial drugs. To date, drug resistance has only been documented in two of the four species, P. falciparum and P. vivax, which is why it remains a public health disease worldwide that has led to the search for new drugs, which can solve the problem of resistance. The main target of this drug is the active site (Qo) of the Cytochrome b protein, a protein involved in the parasite's cellular respiration process. Mutations in this protein, mainly in the Y268th position, have led to processes of resistance to atovaquone. The present research addresses this problem from a theoretical approach, based on a basic principle of evolution, "natural selection", and aims to find bread - inhibitors that can have the same binding affinity on different mutations of the Cyt B protein.</p>

									<h3>4. Nanomechanical properties of PC2 protein</h3>
									<p>Pc2 is a protein of pecualires characteristics because structurally it isconstituted by the same monomer and is tetrameric; hence the present The purpose of the project is to determine the interactions of the money Humans and Echinococcus granulosus by in silico analysis in which nanoelesic properties of the molecules will be identified, amino acids involved in maintaining said characteristic and type of molecular interaction; for which use will be made of the Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) in two ways, with constant force and speed constant; in parallel the binding energy of the molecules will be calculated by through the Free energy pertubation (FEB) technique, through VMD / NAMD GPU.</p>

									<h3>5. Development drug against Injectisome nanomachine</h3>
									<p>The assembly of a series of membrane proteins results in the formation of a supramolecular complex called an injection or molecular needle. Injectionisoma is a molecular machinery developed by various pathogens, mainly bacteria, to send and insert effector proteins or other chemical species to the cytosol of a host cell, which can modulate the immune response thus favoring the onset of infection. Recently, the protein structures that make up injectisomes in various organisms have been explored and determined, which is essential for the understanding of the injection-receptor interaction. This research seeks to generate a Salmonella injection model, determine its conformation states during the interaction and look for potential inhibitors that can be used as drugs, using biomolecular modeling and high performance simulation tools on GPU.</p>

									<h3>6. Targeting Apicoplast Organelle through biomolecular simulation</h3>
									<p>The apicoplasto is a plastic organelle of Plasmodium spp, it participates in the synthesis of fatty acids, isoprenoids and the heme group, thus allowing entry to the host cell and being the only one that works while the parasite is in its dormant state, the which can be the cause of asymptomatic malaria, in this case the pf23 protein is studied which regulates the formation and proteome of this organelle, becoming a therapeutic target, so that we will develop potential inhibitors for drugs for this protein using biomolecular modeling tools, virtual screening, molecular docking and high performance molecular dynamics simulation on GPU.</p>

									<h3>7. Druggable targets in hookworm parasites</h3>
									<p>Tropical and infectious diseases have become one of the biggest health problems worldwide. Among these diseases is hookworm that is caused by the nematode species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, which produce an intestinal infection, consequently chronic hemorrhages and anemia. Given this situation, the objective of this work is the search for potential druggable targets in Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, with potential homology in both species. For this purpose, the data mining in the genome and proteome of both parasites will be analyzed for the selection of enzymes conserved in both parasites, and computational methodologies will be applied such as structural modeling, characterization through the binding pocket of the found target proteins, virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.</p>
